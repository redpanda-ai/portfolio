This is a server that responds to all requests by echoing the result.

It's sole purpose is to demonstrate Jexxus as a clean and concise way to write client and server code.  Future plans are to re-write the Python asynchronous key/value server in Java using Jexxus.  It may also write a Poker server and client program and ask 5 clients to play a million rounds of Poker with different strategies to see which one wins in the long run.
